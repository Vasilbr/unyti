Unity project for developing Sui's in-progress Unity SDK.

Dependencies
SuiDotNet.Client must be built for the netstandard2.1 .NET target.

This should produce 4 .DLL files to copy into in /Assets/Plugins/:

SuiDotNet.Client
Nethereum.JsonRpc.Client
Nethereum.JsonRpc.RpcClient
Common.Logging.Core
When SuiDotNet.Client is changed, the copies in the Unity project must be updated.

Basic Testing
Open the BasicRpcTest scene.

On the "RPC Tests" object, there are a few sub-objects which contain very basic read method test scripts, categorized by data type.

Run the scene with the tests you want enabled to make requests and see results in the debug console.

The default values for transaction digests, objects, addresses etc. in the tests will likely not produce anything on your network - they must be changed to known values from your Sui instance.
